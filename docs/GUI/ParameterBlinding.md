## âœ… [3] Parameter Binding

This plugin uses internal attachments to bind parameters to GUI components.
Each custom component manages its own connection to the ```AudioProcessorValueTreeState``` inside
its class. Additionally, button clink behavior is split between **internal visual updates** and
** external layout changes**.
