## âœ… 4. LookAndFeel System

<br>

**ðŸ”¹ 1. Purpose**

```MyLookAndFeel``` customized the entire plugin GUI by inheriting from ```LookAndFeel_V4```
It unsures consistent **font, colors and component rendering logic**
It is applied at the end of the PluginEditor constructor:

~~~cpp
// Class: EulerDelayAudioProcessorEditor
// Function: Constructor
setLookAndFeel(&mLookAndFeel);
~~~

This comes after all panels are added, to endure no visual inconsistencies.

<br>

**ðŸ”¹ 2. What is LookAndFeel?**

JUCE's ```LookAndFeel``` is a base class designed to fully override the drawing logic for all UI components

~~~cpp
// Class: juce::LookAndFeel
class LookAndFeel : public Slider::LookAndFeelMethods, ...
~~~

It inherits multiple ```LookAndFeelMethods``` and defines many **pure virtual functions**, such as:

~~~cpp
// Class: LookAndFeel
// Function: drawRotarySlider()
virtual void drawRotarySlider(...) = 0;
~~~

This makes it an **interface-like base**, requiring full implementation by the user

**ðŸ”¹ 3. Class Definition and Font Customization**

~~~cpp
// Class: MyLookAndFeel
// Function: Constructor
MyLookAndFeel::MyLookAndFeel()
: mFontOption(juce::Typeface::createSystemTypefaceFor(BinaryData::LatoMedium_ttf,
                                                      BinaryData::LatoMedium_ttfSize))
~~~

- Loads a ```.ttf``` font from binary resources
- Applied in:

~~~cpp
// Class: MyLookAndFeel
// Function: getLabelFont()
juce::Font MyLookAndFeel::getLabelFont(...)
{
    return mFontOption.withHeight(MySize::Font::Height);
}

// Class: MyLookAndFeel
// Function: getPopupMenuFont()
juce::Font MyLookAndFeel::getPopupMenuFont()
{
    return mFontOption.withHeight(MySize::Font::Height);
}
~~~
-> Ensures consistent typeface across labels and popups
